	think	"Wait, she actually thinks about the Gala seriously?"
	
	karla	"\"There's someone that I want to ask...but I don't know if they \n\z
			see it that way. I'm...afraid it would ruin our friendship. \n\z
			I worked so hard for it."
			
	think	"Karla clenches her hands and stands up."

			I take a deep breath in."

	think	"Suddenly, I feel something poke my back and I turn around."
	
	freja	"\"UWAAAH?!?\""
	
	think	"I fall over and step on my tail."

	mathilde	"\"UHHHH, no reason!\""
	
	think		"Mathilde slowly moves back and then suddenly runs off."

	freja	"\"WAIT! COME BACK!!\""
	
	think	"Mathilde tends to do her own thing, but she's friendly to everyone."
	
	
	
	
			
	--freja sneaks into a bush and listens in on karla talking to herself.
	--she then finds mathilde who is hiding in the same bush.
	--scene ends with freja and karla running to school for their first classes of the day.
